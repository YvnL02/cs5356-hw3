            Hi! I'm Yifang, a Computer Science graduate student at Cornell Tech. I have a passion for 
            software development, cloud security, and AI-driven solutions. Currently, I'm working on 
            SecureX, an AI-powered Identity and Access Management startup.

            <summary>What I learned about the details element behavior:</summary>
            <p>The details element is an interactive HTML component that allows users to expand and collapse content.</p>
            <p>The summary tag is required and acts as the clickable heading.</p>
            <p>By default, details starts in the collapsed state unless the open attribute is used.</p>
        </details>

            <summary>What I learned about the transition property:</summary>
            <p>
                I learned that the transition property in CSS allows for smooth animations when an element changes state,
                such as on hover. By applying this property,
                I was able to make the profile picture expand gradually rather than instantly.
